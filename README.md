## Features of invoicer

🧾 A form to enter details of both shopkeeper and his customer like name, address, email, website, invoice number etc. \
🧾 For the CSS part I have used `Tailwind CSS` \
🧾 An amount section in items form which changes dynamically with change in price or quantity created using `useEffect`.\
🧾 An items table with `delete` and `edit` button to delete or edit the items respectively.\
🧾 A total of all the items is also shown at the end done using `useEffect`.\
